A repository for [ASA DataFest 2023!](https://ww2.amstat.org/education/datafest/)

Teams of up to 5 students were given a very large data set with hundreds of thousands of questions for lawyers from their clients. Using this data set, teams would find out ways to extrapolate data that could connect lawyers to their clients and display their findings in front of a panel of judges.

- **Final Presentation:** My group created a gradient heat map showcasing the amount of trials that went to state.
  - We also made a word cloud showcasing the most common terms used for each category of case.
- **Data_AverageClient.ipynb:** I was in charge of extrapolating some of the important information in the data set. In this case, I looked at the differences in data based on ethnicity.
  - **Note: I signed an NDA so I can't show the actual data from clients since it had sensitive information like address, etc.
- **PieChart_EthnicIdentity.ipynb:** A pie chart Imade  that showcases the different ethnic distribution for all clients.
- **Average Client Infographic.pdf:** A hand-drawn infographic made in Procreate showing what the average client would look like.

Overall, I *loved* this event. My group and everybody there were super nice and I wasn't stressed out the whole time. I ended up making a lot of friends and even signed up for a course under one of the professors that was a judge. It was also very professionally handled, and they were nice enough to give us free, healthy food as well! :)
